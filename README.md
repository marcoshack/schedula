# Schedula

It's all about scheduled HTTP callbacks as a service :) For now it's only a toy Go-lang project to play with language resources. But it works.

    go get github.com/marcoshack/schedula

Run with `-h` to check available initialization options

    $GOPATH/bin/schedula -h

There is a example client implementation available in `examples/client`:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/marckshack/schedula
    make

Again, check available options with `-h`

    ./bin/schedula-client -h
